            <div class="body-section">“Whatever it takes to get the job done.” &nbsp;I was raised on this principle and it foster in me a strong work ethic, imbued with a passion for learning, flexible mindset, and desire to be of service.</div>
            <div class="body-section">Hailing from the beach cities of south Los Angeles, and growing up with a world class aquatic athlete for a father, it was fate for me to practically live in the water. &nbsp;My youth was dedicated to swimming and water polo; and for several years, starting at 17, I worked as an Ocean Lifeguard with the Long Beach Fire Department.</div>
            <div class="body-section">Searching for a new experience, I left home and went east to play Division 1 water polo at Bucknell University – though injury ended my athletic career early, even before the end of my first season. &nbsp;While a huge personal blow, I took the new space as an opportunity to cultivate my mind. &nbsp;Through education, I formed an interdisciplinary perspective by way of an undergraduate business degree focused on organizational sustainability and, later, a technical master’s degree in environmental policy.</div>
            <div class="body-section">My schooling was then honed through six years of experience as a research analyst in the public sector. &nbsp;At the South Bay Cities Council of Governments, I served as the Research Director’s sole analyst, where I supported a wide variety of urban planning initiatives from improving local mobility and internet service to addressing climate change and the housing crisis.</div>
            <div class="body-section">Just as diverse as the projects I’ve worked on were my responsibilities within them, including qualitative research, development of quantitative methods, geographic and data analysis, creation and management of internal resources, grant and report writing, project planning, as well as delivering presentations.</div>
            <div class="body-section">I’m eager understand others, who they are, what they need, & how I can help. &nbsp;If you are looking for an agile, independent consultant who thrives on a challenge, I’d love to talk with you about opportunities at your organization.</div>
